Support and Billing
###################

All Citus Cloud plans come with email support included. Premium support including SLA around response time and phone escalation is available on a contract basis for customers that may need a more premium level of support.

Support
-------

Email and web based support is available on all Citus Cloud plans. You can open a support inquiry by emailing cloud-support@citusdata.com or clicking on the support icon in the lower right of your screen within Citus Cloud.

Billing and pricing 
-------------------

Citus Cloud bills on a per minute basis. We bill for a minimum of one hour of usage across all plans. Pricing varies based on the size and configuration of the cluster. A few factors that determine your price are:

- Size of your distributed nodes
- Number of distributed nodes
- Whether you have high availability enabled, both on the primary node and on distributed nodes
- Size of your primary node

You can see pricing of various configurations directly within our `pricing calculator <https://console.citusdata.com/pricing>`_.
