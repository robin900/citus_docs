What is Citus?
==============

Citus horizontally scales PostgreSQL across commodity servers using sharding and replication. Its query engine parallelizes incoming SQL queries across these servers to enable real-time responses on large datasets.

Citus extends the underlying database rather than forking it, which gives developers and enterprises the power and familiarity of a traditional relational database. As an extension, Citus supports new PostgreSQL releases, allowing users to benefit from new features while maintaining compatibility with existing PostgreSQL tools.
