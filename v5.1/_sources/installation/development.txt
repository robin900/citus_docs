Single-Machine Cluster
----------------------

If you are a developer looking to try Citus out on your machine, the guides below will help you get started quickly.

.. toctree::

   single_machine_osx.rst
   single_machine_rhel.rst
   single_machine_deb.rst
   single_machine_docker.rst

Alternatively try running a :ref:`demo cluster<tut_cluster>` which is temporary
and easier to set up. It comes with tutorials to load a stream of live wikipedia
edits into Citus and run interesting queries on them.
